#initialize 3 lists


#define constants as variables (g, mi)


#define dt, general unit of time for program


#initialize time list and fill


#define position, velocity, acceleration, and time dependent quantities


#begin to fill 3 main lists


#define functions and call in for loop for 400000 dt


#detect index of timestamp when velocity and acceleration are at zero. take this quantity and print it
