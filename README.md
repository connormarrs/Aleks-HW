# Aleks-HW
Programs that were assigned by Aleks for homework.
To Do:
        Add gravitational force modification. Calculate accelerations, not forces in order to save a couple multiplications at the expense of one division.
Add plotting function that will graph the acceleration, mass of the rocket, velocity, and position with respect to time.
Add Keplers laws and 3d trajectories
